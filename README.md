### Hello, my name is Eduardo 🖖🏻

<p>I have a great passion for technology. Currently, I work as a full-stack developer at <a href="https://invillia.com/global-growth-framework/" target="blank">Invillia</a>, directly involved with the PagSeguro client. I am also pursuing a degree in Software Engineering, currently in my first year</p>
